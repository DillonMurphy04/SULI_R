Mental health: Covid-19 led to a huge deterioration in my mother's mental health. Caring for her, which is an ongoing effort, was hugely draining for me. I sought psychiatric help and am now medicated as of Fall 2020.

Professional development: Virtual conferences are... difficult to engage with. I haven't had the opportunity to attend any in-person conferences yet. 

Telework tools: My internet connection back in Irvine was largely terrible and I had issues in my hometown as well.

Telework productivity: I took a leave of absence in Fall 2020 because I recognized that I needed to care for my mental health and I was not capable of maintaining pretty much any level of productivity for my job.

I have experienced a huge loss of research time due not just to 3 months of lockdown in which I couldn't enter lab, but also due to the continued delay of research materials to complete my projects. Our lab and several others have experienced delays of up to 6 months just to obtain basic laboratory supplies such as pipettes, without which we cannot complete our experiments. This is detrimental because now my graduate timeline and job seeking timeline are suffering and I'm an nervous I will not have enough papers published to either graduate on time (which impacts my personal/family life) or that even if I do graduate I will not have enough published research during my job search to allow me to obtain a good job following graduation. The second issue, which is related to support, has only exacerbated the time issue. Now that many people are working remotely I find myself taking on more responsibilities in the physical lab than I used to. So now as I need more than ever to be able to focus on my research and writing papers I find myself serving the role not only of graduate student, but also of mentor, lab technician, and lab manager. I'm running around all day distracted by various demand on my time and unable to accomplish what I can to graduate school for in the first place.

But I think the most encouraging was the praise that graduate students were specifically given by our graduate school Dean. He described us as ""heroic"" for how we have continued to pursue our education and bravely come into labs despite this pandemic and all the challenges that it has brought. There was something encouraging and uplifting about that. The reality is that there is very little that can be directly done to help the problems I have faced as a grad student this year, so just the encouragement and acknowledgement of the difficulty has been wonderful from a mental perspective. ","The emails and guidelines were always a bit frustrating (just because it was a lot about what I CAN""T do - and there is a lot of that right now). The uplifting and encouraging communication from the graduate school Dean made me feel appreciated - it made me feel seen - and I think that is something that I really needed at a time when I feel I am working twice as hard just to see half the progress.","I went into my scientific research with more vigor and hope, because I knew that someone noticed my struggle and cared about me and what I do in this community.

There is very little about it that is actually personal and so once I again I just feel like a cog in the machine that will be replaced if it fails to function well. ,"I furiously folded laundry, or deleted the laundry, or fumed during cell culture. I felt that the school administration was looking out for their own interests and didn't truly care about the people impacted by these difficult situations.","I have had conversations with school administration regarding access to vaccinations for students.

I have also tried to explain why offering in-person classes is important to reduce student melt and keep our institution solvent, so that we keep our jobs.","I feel empathetic toward my colleagues, but also empathetic toward the administration, who are trying to walk the fine line between keeping everyone at SNU safe during the pandemic and keeping our institution from bankruptcy.  I have felt empowered because I can discuss these issues in a way that helps my colleagues feel safer AND helps my institution function.

I communicated a lot with students, especially student leaders, about the reasons for cooperating with frequent testing and for reporting illness symptoms to SNU.

In short, we have switched to covid-19 pandemic survival mode from work toward improving our programs to try to increase undergraduate enrollment and alumni success.  ",Woman,No,Heterosexual or straight,White,,"I have a son in college at University of Nevada, Reno, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.  His instruction has been 100% online since covid-19 shutdowns began.  Most of this was not in his control, but he did elect to skip ""optional"" lab courses this past year.  He was a senior.  He wasn't able to participate in the usual group projects and internship that are part of the Mechanical Engineering program.  His College also elected NOT to train their seniors to take the written portion of the PE exam as part of their degree, excusing them from this degree requirement.  He has struggled with low morale and has lost interest in engineering.  I grieve from him and other college students who have been cut off from great hands-on, group capstone projects, which were replaced by remote online theoretical group projects.  I worry that the students graduating during covid have missed opportunities that will impact their careers and income potential.  I worry about their mental health; depression acquired during youth is likely to last a lifetime.

I also have a 29-year-old millennial daughter who entered the job market after college during the Great Recession and has constantly struggled with part-time jobs, sans benefits, and had roommates to stay housed.  She had just made it into hospitality management when covid hit.  She lost some months of work during the initial shutdown, but stayed employed because she was management.  Her employer was greatly negatively impacted, so her advancement prospects are not good.   She and her husband don't ever expect to make enough to afford to have children.  I grieve that they and their age-peers will never be able to recoup the income and savings losses from the Great Recession and covid-19 pandemic.  They are screwed by forces far beyond their control, yet society will continue to blame them for ordering too much avocado toast.  

I am extraordinarily grateful and feel privileged that no one in my family died from covid-19, not lost so much income that they are in serious financial trouble.  It is clear to me that we white, educated, upper-middle-class Americans working in jobs that could be done at home were not nearly impacted as much by this pandemic as poorer people and people of color, who have faced systematic discrimination and been relegated mostly to jobs that must be done at work.  I was more or less aware of this systemic discrimination before covid-19, but now I can point to loads of evidence for it.  

I cannot imagine how hard the covid-19 pandemic was for parents in the U.S.  I have colleagues who leave their school-age kids home alone in order to work.  It makes me angry when state legislators blame the pandemic relief unemployment benefits for the difficulty finding good employees in hospitality and retail.  Don't they realize that lots of these workers died from covid and others cannot work because they have young children and no childcare choices or family members still requiring care after bad covid cases?  

I worked hard for the Democrats and the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020.  I made lots of phone calls and delivered literature to registered Democrats and Independents in my town.  Nevada Democrats elected NOT to knock on doors and engage people in direct discussions, so I only talked to people if they happened to be outdoors or opened the door as I approached their houses.  Initially I was motivated to get rid of Trump, but as the pandemic progressed, my motivation also included putting an administration in place that might be willing to 1) fight for changes that reduce systematic discrimination and racism, 2) change tax codes and social programs to reduce the wealth gap, and 3) change our broken U.S. healthcare system.  I am a little hopeful that covid-19 and its impacts on the U.S. will make these changes more likely, but won't be surprised if they still don't happen with our Congress paralyzed by the two-party system financed by our most wealthy citizens.

I was experiencing a lot of pressure from the department to declare whether I would stay over the summer or graduate in the spring, and I have no idea how long it would take to write a thesis. I was also receiving no guidance on it. This sudden abundance of spare time, coupled with the fact that I wouldn't have to meet with my lame duck advisor again, was definitely welcome.","I started spending about 10 hours a day, every day, working on the thesis, because I promised the department chair I would graduate by the end of May.","Pretty much everything not related to the initial announcement. As an outgoing graduate student, very little of it affects me -- I wasn't going to participate in the graduation ceremony, I don't benefit from the financial package given to universities to distribute to its students, and I'm not working here after this month, so the way its courses are conducted in the future don't affect me. Probably least helpful was the LACK of information, though, about swapping to an online format. It really threw people in the physics department (full of technophobic old men) for a loop, and they were given almost no time and barely any training with online tools. It was a mess and stressful for lots of people.","Pretty annoyed about the sudden online swap without support -- not for me, I'm fine, the professor I work for was decently prepared and I have experience conducting online classes anyway. But a lot of my friends, some of whom were stuck at home in different states, worked for different professors and were suddenly burdened with a lot of extra work, essentially becoming the professor.

This whole pandemic was frustrating in the sense that many institutions operated in ways that aligned with politics (left and right), and not with what was reasonable, sustainable, or scientific. And ultimately it was the individual who took the hit for this.",Submit

I was certainly willing to address one-on-one issues with students who needed accommodations due to COIVD (e.g., student's work schedule, family/elder care issues) but to loosen the standards of a whole class is ludacris and diminishes the equity of the class. These undergraduates are 'adults' and the real world is hard and problems arise that you must overcome.

Even though I wanted to go back, after 3 months of working from home I felt blindsided by the change and very anxious. The shutdown itself also came with no advance warning: even when Governor Newsom shut bars on Sunday the 15th (or 16th?) of March last year, the University had the gym open as normal on that Monday... but we got the announcement late that day that we had to shut down research starting the following day.

I was pleased they were keeping us updated on policies, but felt there was a detachment and coldness that was unpleasant to me.",Followed the new COVID policies because I felt it was important to minimize the spread of COVID at all costs.,"Updates became much, much rarer around May 2020 and have continued that way since.","Frustrated. There was a degree to which I understood things were changing rapidly and that the department & university had limited info, especially since our state government is beyond negligent and unhelpful. However, it was still stressful to have little preparation for teaching, changes in lab policies, and COVID testing & mask requirements.","Nothing, really, since the communication was more of a lack of communication. I just kept obeying the policies I was aware of and continued doing what I personally felt necessary to minimize the spread of COVID.","My partner / roommate is also a PhD candidate in my department, so I have obviously discussed COVID with them a lot both at work & at home. Outside of that, I discussed COVID a good bit with my boss/advisor. He was in another country at the beginning of COVID through July 2020 and things were much more strict & compliant there. I kept warning him that it wasn't the case in the US and especially not in our state, but I don't think he believed me because he was still somewhat bewildered when he came back. Finally, COVID has come up many times during classes I've TAed for, lab meetings, and reading groups (all virtual). But it's usually more of the generic ""hope everyone's safe during COVID."" I think the only other genuine, personal concern I've heard someone express in a meeting is a faculty member (one of my committee members) expressing her fears for her 90-year-old mother and my boss/advisor expressing his concern for his wife who has had to teach high school both in-person & virtually and was very stressed.","Honestly, outside of the conversations I've had with my romantic partner/colleague/roommate, the answer would be very bad. I am disabled and it's been frankly very disturbing to see the utter lack of concern. I know other graduate students & some faculty have traveled cross-country during the height of COVID, they've broken rules surrounding travel & lab personnel, they've posted photos of them doing social activities during the height of COVID...and despite all the ""I hope everyone's safe"" and ""times are hard for people with kids"" and the occasional ""I'm worried for elderly people""....there hasn't been a WORD about disabled people. And some of the people I've talked with know I AND my partner are disabled. None of my conditions made me high risk for COVID thankfully, but to hear people across the country dismiss disabled people as expendable, complaining about how saving lives is killing their social life & work, and constantly raging about having to be at home with their families when there were disabled *children* dying in my state and I'm over here terrified my parents will die (they're older and were in an area with absolutely NO rules at any point) and I'll never see them again or that my disabled partner with organ damage might get COVID and die...I don't want to dismiss problems with work, childcare, etc. especially not for people who actually lost their jobs, but to hear no concern for disabled people & their families has been tough. And in the context of work, I know many of the people I work with know that I'm disabled, and they haven't expressed concern for my physical or mental well-being a single time, despite the constant news & social media coverage of people basically asking disabled & elderly people to just die already. Instead my coworkers find it appropriate to talk about how they flew to California for Christmas break or how they've been having undergraduates come into the lab who've traveled outside the state (was a rule violation) or who aren't employed (still a rule violation).

There were any times where I felt that I needed to withdraw from my classes to ensure my daughter recieved proper care. Last year, a University wide hiring freeze prevented me from hiring employees to carry out a busy research season. This forced me to conduct everything on my own as my research was deemed essential and my advisor was stuck home.

I didn't want to let down my advisor and my academic peers, knowing that I was the only one allowed to continue research, I felt that I HAD to complete it. I felt worn out (too much work for 1 person to take on), emotionally drained (always needing to hold it together since my daughter was with me 24/7), and many times I felt like giving up (I didn't think I could do it, I didn't think it was fair to my daughter, the lack of support caused me to work so much that I wasn't always as sharp as I needed to be to conduct proper research and many experiments failed). What kept me going is my daughter, I wanted to show her how to be strong and make the best out of an unfortunate experience. We adopted the phrase ""Winners never quit"" and lived by those words. My professors and my advisor made me feel important and empowered, they supported me via email by allowing me to miss meetings and submit assignments late. They were impressed with how I carried on despite my circumstances and expressed their feelings which validated my feelings and empowered me to continue. ","I never gave up. I'm still here.

The sense of some return to normalcy has been comforting but I still have extreme trauma from the 2019 and 2020 that has greatly impacted my mental health and well-being as well as my ability to take on the burdening workload associated with a Ph.D. I feel, especially early into the pandemic, as though I was on constant alert waiting for the other shoe to drop and more bad news and hardship to come. Although I am doing much better now I do not feel I will ever truly recover from the trauma I experienced in 2019 and 2020. I do not have the same tolerance for the stress of academia and completing a Ph.D. that I feel I once did and the lingering trauma threatens whenever my stress level with my work reaches a certain threshold.

","I skimmed the emails for anything urgent, and marked them to read later (I was ""shutting down"" from information overload). I was very overwhelmed trying to learn how to use four or five new programs/platforms while trying to figure out how to adapt my courses to the new format.

By the time ""official"" training was offered, I felt I no longer needed it.","The guidance regarding COVID management was not nearly as clear as it could have been, such as masking guidelines (i.e., do face shield count?). As an instructor, I had to spend more time than I felt necessary trying to get answers to questions like this. The university did try to keep on top of the frequently changing situation (basing their information on CDC guidelines), but there was little to no transparency regarding positive-testing students and the information about how to proceed when students reported positive COVID results was vague and confusing (once we resumed in-person classes in the fall of 2020). It also seemed as though the website information was rarely updated in Spring 2021, and it was unclear if we were supposed to continue steps such as sanitizing our work spaces (desks, tables) before and after use.","It was very frustrating, because we are trying to keep both ourselves and our students safe but were not always given clear guidance for how to accomplish that. It also seemed there were little to no ramifications for students who ignored COVID guidelines (going to parties, ignoring quarantine orders). ","I tried to find answers when questions came up (which often resulted in long email discussions and many phone calls). In Spring 2021, when it was unclear how stringent we were supposed to be regarding sanitizing spaces, I continued following the processes implemented in the fall (reminding students to sanitize their spaces before and after use, sanitizing my own work spaces, maintaining social distancing, mask wearing, etc). It seemed that this was about all I could do, given the university didn't seem to be doing much to prevent positive, asymptomatic students from attending classes.","I have had conversations with all my course supervisors, the department head, the Office of Dean of Students, and the Office of Disability Services regarding issues such as whether face shields were compliant with the mask policy, what to do if students refuse to wear masks, and what to do if notified of a COVID-positive student (in terms of potentially exposing myself and other students). There were also several department-wide meetings regarding COVID policies, such as masks, cleaning, late work, etc. and how they should be addressed.","Overall, I generally felt I was able to get answers when I had questions, although the answers themselves were sometimes unsatisfactory and resulted in me needing to contact a different person/department.

It was very difficult to have receive emails/video calls from students that expressed how scared they were by having to be in quarantine, how they were struggling emotionally, etc, while I was also struggling with my own COVID generated emotions, grief, and fears. The remainder of the semester following the initial transition to online-only instruction (when lock-down was first announced) was the hardest for everyone. The University also recognized the emotional toll, and developed better mental health resources for Fall 2020 (which they continually improved upon throughout the academic year) to assist with this. It was also very difficult to deal with student frustrations over the changed curriculum/methodologies (such as transitioning to flipped classes), as those changes were often out of the hands of the individual instructors. Furthermore, students often failed to understand the sheer amount of time and effort put in by their instructors to create new materials/videos, adapt the courses, develop new assessment strategies, etc. while still trying to manage their own COVID related problems. I personally had a very difficult time handling student frustrations (typically expressed via rude or snotty emails) as I experienced the loss of both friends and family during this time, and was not able to attend their funerals due to COVID mandates/restrictions/safety measures.

For some mathers, it has been a liberating experience, while for others, the abrupt loss of certainty, control, and human contact has fueled a strong desire to get back to what we used to do. Many of these challenges are based on deep-seeded beliefs around teaching, about mathematics, and about social issues, which for a long time have not been considered part of mathematics teaching and learning. As a department chair, I feel it is best that the chair continue to operate with a reasonable sense of neutrality because the spectrum is wide. At the same time, a majority of mathematics education research is pre-COVID  and the experiences that folks are referencing are based on a pre-COVID paradigm, which I’m not convinced actually exists anymore. At the same time, I believe both that some educational research and much of our prior experience will be valid in a post-COVID world, but right now, it is impossible to know what will be most useful.

1.We've gone to remote teaching so I'm not sure how to reach all my students who are also dealing with Covid stress.
2.  A PD event was canceled do to Covid and I was bummed by that.
3.  I'm adjunct and enrollment is dropping.  I work at two separate community colleges to pay my bills but for the first time I won't have classes at one of the campuses and this fall, I will be short as well.  I now get to file for unemployment for the first time in my life.
4.  My internet keeps crashing and it takes me weeks to get it going again.  I'm buying access through an insecure hot spot which takes hours to upload lectures and files.
5.  Not too little but too much.  I haven't had a day off in months.  I am working 24/7 to keep curriculum developed just ahead of the students.  My grading is multiplying like bunnies.  I am working for less than minimum wage when you put in the number of hours I work and what I get paid.  Administration at both campuses pretty much say, suck it up, buttercup.","Yes, explicitly mentioning COVID-19",,"PCC has been very good about communicating about their process for evaluating and decision making process on whether we should be remote learning or f2f.  We are scheduled to be remote through fall and maybe winter (which is most likely).  My other school, Clackamas Community College is waffling on fall.  They stated that we would be online but now that the county has started to reopen, they say they will reevaluate for fall.  Idiots!","Mostly, I appreciate PCC's efforts to keep us informed.  Our president has sent out some pretty honest emails and that's great.  One of the most stressful things is not knowing how we are going to teach.  We've heard rumors that other colleges are talking about having instructors teach the SAME class both in and online version and f2f but only getting paid for one.  It helps to have Deans that have taught and hopefully will put an end to that ridiculous notion.  Otherwise, if that crops up here, we will have to make it a union issue.","I am a biologist.  Nothing that was conveyed in those communications came as a surprise and I think some of it wasn't as realistic as it needed to be.  However, I can also see that sometimes you don't tell everybody everything as it can be more confusing for the nonbiologists.  We've had some nonbiology instructors clamoring for f2f labs in the fall.  The biologists just look at each other and shake our heads.  ","All the information has been helpful but it has come in piecemeal.  It would be nice if the college would set up a Covid resource page and just keep sending us the link for that to check things out.  For example, if your students are hungry, here are three links for resources.  Next email, here's a link for getting your students counseling.  Next email, here's a link for.......  You get the picture.","Frustrated!  Like I said, it was a lot of useful information but hard to keep track of it.  I would have to sort through hundreds of emails to find try to find those emails.  I might do that this summer (since I will be short a couple of classes) and put up my own resource page.  ","Nothing yet.  Still too busy to do anything but develop curriculum, record lectures and grading.  Argh!","Our dean has been making a real effort to be there for us which is appreciated.  However, I mostly talk to colleagues/friends about these things.","I appreciate that our dean is making an effort to be supportive.  However, the real connections are with the groups of people that I am developing curriculum with for this quarter.  There are three of us and we get together on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to put our lab together for the next week.  Our Friday meetings have been taking longer as we go on because we are spending more time venting about our week.  No matter how much support you get from your family and significant others, nobody understands the pressure faculty have been under to transition to remote learning in a limited time frame.  I haven't totally lost my marbles yet this quarter due to my peeps.  ","Laugh, cry, share stories, ask for advice, provide advice, help problem solve and generally be there for one another.  Why?

They rent an apartment from friends who watch out for them but I find myself having to encourage my mom to take dad and get out of the house safely.

Subject: Upcoming COVID-19 Research Disruption Fund
Date: July 1, 2021

This message is to make you aware that the Offices of the Executive Vice President for Research and Partnerships and the Provost, with support from the Treasurer, are establishing a COVID-19 Research Disruption Fund. The guidelines to apply for an award from this fund will be made available to the Purdue research community in the coming weeks.

We realize that the COVID-19 pandemic may have disrupted, delayed, or cancelled sponsored research projects. The impact was more serious for many research programs that involved human subjects, international travel, longitudinal studies, and other similar activities. These circumstances may mean that these investigators may have lost opportunities to collect critical samples or data required to complete the proposed work or longitudinal studies. These programs may have also incurred additional pandemic-related expenses, reduced, or cancelled funding, or new payroll costs.

The COVID-19 Research Disruption Fund will be used to award one-time limited financial support to principal investigators that experienced the greatest negative impact on long-term research outcomes. Applications will be evaluated based on criteria such as the loss scholarly publications, significant delay in Ph.D. student graduation, and competitiveness for future sponsored program funding.

Funding applications will be open to all principal investigators, including tenure-track, tenured, research, and clinical faculty, with sponsored research/start-up funded research that experienced delays, disruptions, or cancellations directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 Research Disruption Fund will be made up of resources from the 2021 EVPRP Bridge Program, the 2021 Provost Research Restart Program, and the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). We anticipate awarding up to $1.5M from this fund before Dec. 31, 2021. Funds must be spent by April 30, 2022. 

Again, the application guidelines will be shared with all faculty in the coming weeks.

I was very anxious about being able to communicate effectively with students from home.  I was very stressed about needing to lead virtual lab activities online with students rather than work with them in the lab.  I had a lot of anxiety about using new technology to teach remotely.   Students reported that they were unfamiliar with navigating the course and completing / submitting assignments once we switched to remote learning. ,Other,Our Safety Office at NDSU emailed us weekly to report safety policies and plans,My institution emailed regarding expectations for employees to work remotely.  The most helpful thing has been emails from my direct supervisor relaying lab expectations and how to talk with students about the plans for remote learning.  My supervisor set more strict expectations for social distancing than the university as a whole. ,I felt that NDSU was striving for transparency and that when I talked to my supervisor via email that he valued my safety and that of other students. ,"I stayed home from school as much as possible.  I only went to school two times after being told to stay home because I did not have the technology at home to complete work assignments.  I wore a mask when I did have to go to campus, and washed my hands well after visiting the lab.  I did this because my supervisor was adamant that NDSU had COVID-19 cases and he wanted his students to stay off NDSU property for safety reasons.  He instead told us what he expected us to do from home (teaching assistant tasks, writing manuscripts, completing graduate coursework, etc...)  ",I think the information I received from NDSU was helpful information regarding CDC recommendations and how NDSU was planning to keep students safe. ,I felt glad that NDSU was communicating the institution’s plans to me. ,I stayed home and taught remotely as was ordered by my supervisor. ,"I have been meeting weekly with my doctoral advisor to discuss my progress with my studies and lab / teaching duties.  My advisor also listens to any personal concerns I have such as anxiety about teaching remotely or completing assignments for my classes.  He makes helpful suggestions regarding ways I can get around technology issues I have encountered, or where to look for teaching resources. ",I always feel better after a videoconference with my advisor.   I worry a lot about teaching remotely as well as the online class I was taking.  He listens to my concerns and either offers suggestions or helps me put my concerns into perspective. ,I am able to move forward with my teaching responsibilities and studies as a result of these communications because I have a clearer understanding of what to do next. ,Supported,Laleh,I need to know still how safe it is to move forward with the planned return to campus in the fall.  I am concerned about the reliability of antibody testing and future vaccination plans.   I have been carefully watching the CDC website for the most recent COVID-19 information. ,NO CHANGE,,Somewhat,Because of COVID-19 there will be only online summer courses at NDSU.  The instructor who was to teach BIOC 260 did not want to generate online instructional materials.  Therefore I will be teaching the BIOC 260 class this summer with another graduate student.  We will be designing an online course with synchronous recorded lectures and virtual office hours.  Due to COVID-19 I have been asked to work from home this summer.  I will be expected to write up my research findings for publication. ,Woman,No,Heterosexual or straight,White,,"It’s very hard to be productive at home.

I have also tried going outside for a walk when I feel really bad and that does help.  I have had a telemedicine visit with a psychiatrist to try to figure out how to cope better.   Thankfully my cat knows when I am anxious and will come sit by me, which helps.  When I have video conferences that stress me, the cat will sit in my lap and let me pet her so I stay calm.

6/4/2021 13:42:45,R_BtvJQqb7xgoqreN,removed for now,removed for now,,STEM Education and Learning ,,Student,Graduate student (second-year or above),,Ph.D.,None of these,,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,"I have several kids that are elementary school age and below, so the biggest issue that we dealt with was the repercussions of remote learning. Like many parents, I had to drastically reconfigure my schedule in order to be present for remote learning. Fortunately, my spouse has been a homemaker throughout our marriage, so the adjustment was not as jagged as it could have been. However, having more than 5 children at home, every day, for the better part of one year was very taxing on the mental health of everyone in our home. My professors were understanding and willing to make accommodations in the spring, but there were few (if any) offers during the fall and spring semesters from professors to make accommodations. It seemed as if the sentiment was equivalent to a ""don't ask; don't tell"" sort of informal agreement between teachers and students regarding the need for accommodations. So, I did what I had to do. I'm just glad that my poor spouse survived. When our school finally decided to return to in-person schooling and we got our three elementary school kids out of the house consistently, it was like someone had opened the curtain to let light into a pitch-black room. Within a week or two the mental health and status of our family relationships improved dramatically. I don't feel like anyone was ever in danger of being harmed, but I definitely think my spouse was experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression (without hope of relief) for a large portion of the pandemic. As a STEM educator, I recognized many of the issues and reasons for the school to choose to remain remote. However, it was also difficult to see my parents, who both work in the education system in a red state, to go to school in-person for almost the entire 2020-2021 school year and see them largely unworried about COVID-19 (even though there were periods where there were a lot of cases and they seemed to be spreading through the schools). I thought to myself, ""If they can make it through in-person, why can't they just let my kids go back to school in-person?"" Once again, I recognize the differences between a metropolitan and a rural area and the difference in opinion between a strong conservative area and a moderate area that leans towards liberal thinking. Nevertheless, the affective emotions that I experienced were not always logical. Yet, the affective reactions that I experienced seemed to have the strongest hold on me during the early stages of the pandemic. This was a long (and rather rambling) response, but I hope it helps to frame my experience.",0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,,,"I have already addressed most of the issues that I experienced in the previous section. The only other thing that I will address here is the loss of social networking within the department that I experienced as the pandemic progressed. I have the impression that graduate school (at least in this program) is comprised of a set of acquaintances (and some close friendships) that flourish as people intermingle throughout the workday. However, that sense of community has (for me, at least) largely disappeared over the course of the pandemic. There have been infrequent attempts to keep up group chats, and over the course of the year our once well-connected cohort has disintegrated into a set of isolated friend groups that rarely interact with each other anymore. I come to the office to do my work because I needed the peace and quiet that I could not get with all my kids at home during the pandemic (although I certainly tried when I could tell my spouse was nearing the end of her sanity), and I have seen hardly anyone from the graduate program (including and especially the faculty) during the last 14 months. In fact, I've only had an office mate here at the same time as me once during that time. I understand that as students start to move towards the completion of a Ph.D. that there is a natural drifting apart as people dig into their research. However, that effect has only been exacerbated by the pandemic. I feel like we are now a department of individuals and (not necessarily harmful or dismissive) cliques, rather than a community.","Yes, explicitly mentioning COVID-19",,"Most of the COVID-19 communication has been logistical. I'm sure there has probably been internal communication about accommodations to school work that I haven't seen, but most of the communication has said things like: ""Here is the new policy on masks."" ""Here is the link to our COVID-19 website."" ""Get your vaccine"" or ""Here is a link to sign up to get your vaccine."" ""You have been randomly selected for a [seemingly] mandatory COVID-19 test."" ""Here is a list of resources (e.g., counseling, health services, financial services) if you need them."" ""Here is how we will adjust the academic calendar because of COVID.""","From an administrative standpoint, there is little that they can do to reach out to each person individually. Instead, the most appropriate response is likely to send out blanket emails of the sort that I described above pointing the community to resources or logistical details of which they should be aware. It would have been nice to have some sort of individual communication or ""buddy program"" where I had an individual (or small group) of accountability and welfare partners to follow up on how I was doing. Unfortunately, these programs rarely work well when they are mandated, but introverts like me don't always do the best job of reaching out to others when we need help. So I guess even a communication assigning me two or three students to ""check on"" here and there would have felt more like a chore unless I had chosen to create such a group myself.","Most of the time I rolled my eyes about ""mandatory"" COVID testing. I understood the need and the significance of the testing, but I did grow up in a very conservative area, so the idea of being ""forced"" into a new behavior by the college didn't necessarily sit well with me. I appreciated the emails about resources, although I rarely kept up with them because I was so busy at home with my family. Most emails got a cursory glance and a quick delete.","I don't think that there has been any communication that has negatively impacted the day-to-day work that I've done at the university. Likely, the only thing that has been a pain has been the random COVID-19 testing emails. ","It is annoying to have to schedule an appointment in the next 48 hours during a semester, even though the university tried to make it as convenient as possible. I'm an organization freak, and having to suddenly make room in my schedule for something is not something I enjoy.","Unfortunately, I'm also someone who typically tries to conform with mandates because I don't like the tension and confrontations that come with fights. So I always went to the testing. I was sorely tempted to sit one out just to see what would happen, but I also recognized the theoretical reasons that the university had for conducting mandatory testing, even if some of the methodology was annoying.","Most of our conversations were informal discussions between graduate students regarding whether or not we needed to wear masks when we were in each other's offices, if and when we were going to get vaccinated, and how the COVID pandemic was playing out in our individual lives. As I said earlier, most of our cohort and department social gatherings ended (at least, I stopped getting invitations to attend or inclusions in group chats if events did occur), so I only talked with the students that I was in class with or happened to be in their offices. One other story that may be pertinent. Just as everything was starting to shut down last spring (this was probably late March or early April 2020), I was nearing the end of one of the most work-intensive and cognitively intensive semesters of my program. I sent out what I considered a ""public service announcement"" to the instructors of my courses, letting them know that I might end up asking for accommodations depending on how my home situation worked out. One of my professors was very kind and said that she would work with me in whatever way she needed to in order for me to pass her course, including giving me extra time after the semester (via an incomplete grade). The other professor basically told me to suck it up and keep working. Granted, the second professor may have read my email as inferring that I might leave the graduate program if things got bad enough (which was not my intention, although I will always put my family before academia if I have to make a hard decision).","The social interactions were very nice. As always, people have different opinions and we didn't always agree or empathize in the most appropriate ways, but overall things went well. With regard to the story that I added about my two professors' emails, there was a time when I was angry with both of them, but also a time when I was satisfied or even glad of their response. Neither professor offered to excuse me from any work, which was something that I secretly hoped for. Granted, both professors drastically overhauled their final projects on the fly, so I really did do less work. But I was a little frustrated with the second professor because I felt like she hadn't truly ""lowered the bar"" for the course, when in fact, she had (just not in the way that I wanted). I was angry at the second professor for quite some time. Yet, as I reread his response at a later time, I realized that his intent had likely been more of a ""tough love"" approach than a dismissal. This professor knew that the trouble of the pandemic would eventually pass, and that my time in the program (and my life in general) would extend far beyond the timeline of the pandemic. I think his approach was to try and dissuade me from making a rash decision while reminding me of the adage ""this too shall pass."" Once I reframed (in my mind) his words into this context, I was grateful for what he said and did.","Well, I did what I had to in order to finish the semester. It was extremely unfair, but hey, when is life fair? Once I acknowledged the fact that sacrifice was the only thing that was going to get me through the semester, I did what I needed to, both on the home front and the school front, to finish the semester strong.

There was a lot of time-consuming work associated with creating content and weekly assessments for my organic chemistry course, as well as responding to emails. Spending time on these activities was the least of my difficulties that semester. I spent a lot of my emotional resources navigating how to support students in distress. I received a lot of emails from students pouring their hearts out to me, telling me about the struggles that they were going through. Instead of just simply asking for an extension, my students would often describe the reasons why they need extensions, and this often included an outpour of distress and anxiety (e.g., struggles, mental health issues, deaths in their families). Responding to emails like that took a lot of time and consideration because I wanted to be thoughtful and supportive in my responses and find words to express my compassion and support. There is no doubt that in this regard Fall 2019 was nothing like Fall 2020! Finally, I had to learn the procedures associated with reporting concerning student behavior (sadly I received a suicidal email from a student, something that was very distressing and concerning, which threw me out of the loop for a whole day). I also had to learn the procedures associated with academic integrity investigations (receiving reports from Chegg) and the reporting process (holding meetings with students and filling out the official documentation).

Most of the conferences got cancelled. For this reason, 7 oral and poster talks from the group were accepted but cancelled, including an invited presentation that I was supposed to give at the National Spring 2020 ACS conference.
